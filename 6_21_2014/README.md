- wokring on windows fo rmore than 10 yerrs. stron gpreseence with games. Ove th last 4 hours they've working hard. There has never been a better time to write a game. We've gone to the point of writing one game for mulitple devices.

Threes things:
- convergence
- middleware
	making sure working across platforms.
- great programs for gamesrs. really great time to get started writing games.

### Micsrosfot platorm
- laptop, xbox, mobile. all on one platform. all are baesed on API. 

- only microsft has manged to do this. ??
- same platform used to program ten year. (directx). this platform frrom beginnign was build for games.   
- quite a good platform.   connected srvices. (windows azure, store install, xbox live, etc.)

### Reduced cost: creating or porting.
- Not oeverywone will write on dirextx. Microsofrt has been working with .  google chrome - runs opengl platform on top of directx. 
- provides various services. (ads, stats).
- case study. difficult with selling games. (android). after transporting to (windows?) quite a thousands sellings. 
- Suck as much as you can.
- Unity 4 beta fo rwindows.
- example of create as imple game only for deskopt. little sellings. after porting to mobile.
- you can download a game? and check code. 99% of code is shared.
- export: windows mobile - universal. creates shared project? (research).
	- various features - capturing images & videos and sharing.

## Steps.
1. Create project.
	- File -> new project -> select package ->  change to 3D (even though it's 2d) -> create.
	- windows -> layout -> 2 by 3..
	-> change to 2D mode.

2. Importing.
	- export/unzip 2D contents -> sprints01 -> find image called: big_island_hill -> drag and drop -> Assets folder.
	- assets is the folder where ou store your objects, desings, and code. 
	- use spring better performance. automatically import as sprite. (edit -> editor -> default behavior -from 3D to 2D. then gdrag and drop whole foldersprints01 ) (everything is automtcally is stted as sprites.
	- drag and drop flag. (scale -> select image-> seelct 5th option -> scale) create first level.

	recap: edit-> project settings -> editor-> behavior mode to 2D, then drag and drop thei whole folder to assets.
	drag and drop flat istland, and scale accrodinly. 

3. camera 
	-> chang eto perspectives. -> click on 2D, and holding alt lo
	ok around., then click on blue axe, and move forwards, backwwrd. problem,, trees goes back and forwards, bug. 
	-> solution to bug: creat layers. make firt layer, then put your object there. how od you create layer: up right: layers -> eid layers -> sortin layers ->  click on plus button -> background, level, fouregrounds. the lower the more front in the camera. (everyting you create goes in the bacgkround :( ) picking object, chang elayer to bak) (shift to mutliselect -> level).  change layer of each object accordinlgy. CAREFUL. layer. defautl movement layer forward. 
	recap -> layers, edit layer, add layers (back, leve, etc.) ->
